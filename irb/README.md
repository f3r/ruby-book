# Ruby Shell

## IRB
The [Interactive Ruby Shell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Ruby_Shell) (IRB) is a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) program that comes with ruby and allows us to interact with ruby.

This is similar to the coffeeScript "[coffee](http://coffeescript.org/documentation/docs/repl.html)" REPL, or the Javascript REPL from the [chrome console](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console).

```
$ irb

2.1.2 :001 > puts "hi there"
hi there
 => nil
```

IRB gives us a sandbox environment to play with ideas and learn. Later on it will also serve as a really good tool to debug your programs.
