# Ruby Koans

A [kōan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C5%8Dan) (_公案 /ˈkoʊ.ɑːn/_) is a story, dialogue, question, or statement, which is used in Zen practice to provoke the **great doubt** and test a student's progress in Zen practice.

## Goals

- Understand the fundamentals of the ruby programming language
- Be able to fork a repository and be able to contribute back via pull request


## Ruby Koans setup

### Fork the repository

Go to the [wdi rubyKoans](https://github.com/wdi-hk-sep-2014/ruby_koans) repository  and [git fork it](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) into your personal github account by clicking on the fork button right.

  You should have something like this:
  ```
  https://github.com/__YourGithubUser__/ruby_koans
  ```

### Clone the repository

[Git Clone](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your repository to your laptop, so you can start working on it locally

  ```
  git clone git@github.com:__YourGithubUser__/ruby_koans.git
  ```

  _Tip:_ In UNIX systems (including Linux and MacOS) you can get help on most of the available console commands by using the ["man"](http://www.linfo.org/man.html) command (ie. "man top"). To read about git subcommands (clone, push, add), you'll have to type "man git-clone" or "man git-add"
